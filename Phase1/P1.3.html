		<h3>Intention</h3>
		<p>Audrey does not live near any coffee shops and works from home, so she would like to stock up on coffee she can brew without leaving the comfort of her home. She is also homesick, and would love some a variety of authentic Korean and American cofee flavors</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Action</h3>
		<p>Audrey is always tired in the mornings, but does not want to leave her home and drive just to get coffee. So she buys herself a coffee machine and begins to look for coffee blends and pods from her laptop.

        <h3>Resolution</h3>
        <p>She orders her coffee pods online and can now enjoy drinking coffee in the morning without leaving her home</p>
